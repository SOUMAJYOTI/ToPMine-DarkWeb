technical terms tor provides privacy by separating identity from routing online in a normal session online you re browsing from your computer or a router that s assigned its own ip address every request you send out carries that address and information is returned there when you use to instead of your chat message or the uri you type going directly to its destination it s routed through tor s network of volunteer nodes moving through at least three of them before exiting the network and proceeding to the endpoint the website that receives it doesn t know what your ip address is nor does any point in the tor circuit except for the entry relay for most users a tor session does not feel different from going on the web with the firefox browser but all the winding through relays does slow things down and the default settings disable some functions for security reasons including plugins that allow videos but they can be turned back on syverson and other researchers have written voluminous about tor s weaknesses the network operates within the wider web and the way users behave and configure their computers outside tor is one of the biggest sources of insecurity one way the nsa found to get around tor s software and spy on users was an attack called egotisticalgiraffe exploiting a vulnerability in the firefox browser another approach was to try to reconstruct the encrusted path to find the identity of a tor user by monitoring relays according to the tor stinks presentation success with this approach was eligible because all three hops in the circuit had to be part of the set nsa could monitor and the agency had access to few of them there is a deeper layer of tor where information is hasted called hidden services these sites are ragged with the extension onion and can only be accesse using tor a regular internet user s traffic goes through at least three hops hidden services traffic goes through at least six italian activists during the green movement

network and therefore communications stay encrusted therefore if a relay node is comprised the only information available will be the source not necessarily you it as its more likely to be the previous tor relay and the destination however in the case of accessing a clear net site the final tor relay node will act as what is known as the exit node if the original data you sent is not encrusted for example a standard http site then once this data leaves the exit node it will be in its unencrypted state again this means if the tor relay that is used an exit node is comprised then all unencrypted data is susceptible to being captured in an interpretable state i think any tor relay node can be an exit node and this is chosen during your connection to the tor circuit on each connection and probably when you use the new identity button the intelligence agencies probably host a lot of tor nodes in the hope of intercepting your data it would make sense to at least . hidden

value and set it to zero preference name network user settype integervalue if thats so am i crazy to set those setting back just to get into nun forums or should this be taken as a sign that nuk forums are unsafe to visit because they compromise anoniminity . it probably came from pasting the link as you said the referrer is not necessarily a trail it can be added after clicking a link and merely contains the info about what page the link is clicked on the point of the referrer is so the site can make sure that you have visited the home page first or some other check to ensure that you followed the link from where the site wants you to come from it was originally intended for diagnosing problems in a site but designers started adding referrer checks to make sure that you may have

not necessarily a trail it can be added after clicking a link and merely contains the info about what page the link is clicked on the point of the referrer is so the site can make sure that you have visited the home page first or some other check to ensure that you followed the link from where the site wants you to come from it was originally intended for diagnosing problems in a site but designers started adding referrer checks to make sure that you may have visited a particular page first or whatever they can use this to prevent certain types of bot access for instance the settings

post it myself syd . when i visited it about a month ago i couldnt register an account without applying big key now its needed only to upgrade to vendor account so probably they are leaving beta . are

keep control of the website that was clearly hacked up pretty bad i mean they stop registration but that only stopped genuine contributers from getting accounts on the forum so only spammers could register new accounts it was a mess hopefully they write down the mac adrresss of the offending computers like i do and redirect their incomming attacks to their blacklist of mac addresses like i also do when i get around to it or if you get some nasty shit on your computer server you can put it to good use . i have no idea . ahhh ya got me i was just gon na edit that away but i have been doing

infernal supercaptcha lol i noticed the captcha was something that reminded me of them old school comics where you had to wear some red tinted glasses to see the image d sorta it worked i guess ppl were posting less cause it was near impossible to get it right the st time what i wondered though was a bot doesnt use human eyes to figure out the captcha so what does making it near impossible to read do to stop the bots from figuring it out because the coding required for pattern recognition is very very difficult and requires a lot of computing power i bet what they are using for the captchas are de captcha services whereby they grab the image and send it over to the aforementioned services where they have bunches of people actually solving them and sending them back usually in places like india where they hire kids to work hour weeks and pay them next to nothing also some of the newer services use a combination of ocr and human labor to get them solved making the captcha infernally difficult to figure out slows them down but will not stop them the only solution is having a mod in the forum which evidently they dont want to do . i did some shopping for bots lol will buy you one that will crack anything they put up with or support if the captchas are modified it does indeed take computer power though and i guarandamntee you that exactly why the forums have slowed

have no understanding whatsoever of a client server relationship let it be known indian never has used decapthca service in china or india or anywhere else unnecessary the flooders like tes gaylordfaulker could be causing the poor performance and timeouts indian respects abraxas and would not overload the server with requests alternatively it could be a deliberate ddos by someone like nightfox who has sworn to get bots banned at all costs endianchief is right that the computing load is placed on the server performing the decaptha service not being either his or abraxas hes also right his bots are oded the right way so as not to overwhelm the forums with traffic and not flooding the forums with topics pushing people out fo the way in the interest of full disclosure he gave me a boost for a while on one of his bots i did not ask for this help he graciously offered it without asking for anything back so in grateful for his brief help however i dont know if the staff wants to spend the time sorting good bots from bad bots and the right answer to be fair to the majority of users that cant code for shit is to ban the bots altogether . this will take a min since the team over at abraxas were swatting them down like a mosquitoes infestation but the names will be indeed here soon . im unable to acess the forum as well off an on mostly off . you guys are just wrong . quote

thought the site was free for anyone to enter . if anyone is in need to an invite to dhl pm me on here ill send over the link with the demise of abraxas it might be time to start looking at direct deal market to stop the exit scams so far i have been impressed with del think they may be around for some time xxmiaxx . nah they locked it down for a while not sure why never had that much interest in joining multiply markets . lol captcha was globular tea time teaser solved . you have to keep in mind agora in the upper left corner still calls out the sites in beta dhl has made an accelerated push sine june to officially go live i still hope agora re opens as they have been a dnm bench mark due to the security and longevity this take nothing away from backcopy and bmr as they ran an above the board dnm site and had the communities best interest imo in a shady time of scammers and thieves . lol captcha was globular tea time teaser solved . i always thought it weird when peeps asked about red links cause i thought the site was free for anyone to enter . i do not use much the markets i preffer direct orders by email this days and avoid the all ordeal of seeing your funds disappear but ive been looking around for a few new vendors lately and give been browsing the markets for it and i have to say i am thoroughly impressed with del give been registered for some time but never logged on much before however every time i do they seem to be implemeting new features and actively showing work done their layout is really nice and simple they have a superb if limited selection of vendors and several great features such as automatic encryption of all messages requiring to sign a new pgp key if changed javascript enabled alert possibility of direct pay with discount etc and very important for me is the fact that it is exclusively dedicated to the commerce of drugs i am really put off by other markets that allow goods and services such as fire arms scamming and fraud i just

to buy a zip of jack frost from empath and from now on ill just deal with him elsewhere or direct didnt have trouble with deposits but the system is designed to steal your spare change not only is the

which the stock standard response from the mods is you been wished end of discussion i know a lot of people do get wished especially given how the methods of stealing peoples bitcoin has evolved but some of these people claim to have fa actuated so unless they are all lying id say thats one good reason to avoid it give heard it rumored that admins will target vulnerable accounts with no fa and just steal deposits also the place is run by scammers and thieves so i think its a pretty safe bet to say that they will exit scam just a matter of when many people will continue to use it though regardless because they are happy to take the risk of potentially losing their coins for the convenience of having a stable market which makes no sense to me when there are far more safer alternatives out there . quote from trust in us on march pmtl drto trust such a place is pure idiocymuch lovetrusttrust . i figured out what happened in the end i didnt read the fine print must deposit min guess i found a small bug though if you send less than required amount the address on the account does not rotate over till there has been at the least btc in the wallet interesting so i deposited xxx amount

never did reset anything password pin been using the account religious to at the least get all the kick backs from using its child account aside from phishing i think a lot of the complaints you see highlighted on ab are the same elsewhere when it comes to the learning curve called read everything on the page dont just skip through shit clicking buy in a haste stick to dnm protocol and all that neck beard shit . never had a problem with ab but i play it smart i put money in for the amount of the sale hour prior to the sale if for some reason i have money coming back it leaves them asap not going to leave coins just sitting there like its a prepaid visa i also never buy large amounts of anything . standard safety also if compelled to order life time sentence orders always take the extra steps for safety multiply drops spaced out orders etc . give been a part of ab for some time now only put money in right when youre ready to spend it . what about outlaw theyve been around for a while

after though i think backopy bmr admin was inspired by dprs project sr the first darkness drug market im aware of was private it was a public rc forum then became private clearnet rc forum invites required then moved to a onion named to skunk forum and allowed all drugs to be sold traded this conversion to a dnm was in feb at the latest the next one im aware of dsr started as a private clearnet all drugs allowed forum in or that moved to onion some time in late that private forum was one of the forums whos members became the vendors and admit s of ovdb in ovdb was conceived in possibly earlier was under development in late was deplored in just barely after sr became the first to deploy open dnm sr may have been conceived before ovdb was i say this because of sr s revolutionary format it must have taken quite some time to put together but i have some doubt about that dpr was an unknown character not involved on any of the private forums as far as anyone knows it was pretty difficult to get on private forums unless you were already on at least one speaking of over one of the big acid vendors there was a guy from belgium called tarpaulin he ripped off so many people for so much money and was banned from over funny that tarpaulin has appeared at tmg recently and is active he must really like that name see on there was another also private all drugs allowed clearnet forum called drug friends which required invites from topic people when it was established as a org late df eventually became a onion private forum spring at the earliest and dec at the latest my memory is not great on this one pip then pip after pip died were learned private all drugs allowed forum from many years ago pip eventually moved to a onion july and became pit it was hasted at freedomhosting and went offline when the feds took that server down in august there were a few other scattered small private darkness drug forums that started in i dont know any of those that still exist there was a rc only forum that went onion in i think early it didnt last long at all scams and mismanagement and scams by management ripped it apart quote from emmet on february pmfarmers market was around before bmr ovdb more of a forum was around before fm and bmr thats right farmers market tfm was around way before most other drug markets as a clearnet forum that was open to the public they moved to a onion a little too late they were already being investigated anyway though busted in april the wikipedia article says tfm moved to a onion in that may be so but it must have been late because i remember other forums had already moved to onions most were of course glad to see that tfm was taking their security more seriously some users gave up because it was too hard for them to use or too slow most got on board maybe is when adamflowers started as the dea seems to assert it could have been earlier if anyone really wants to know go to and put in the search bar and look at it so see when adamflowers first vendor ad appeared quotebut if we actually want to go back to the first real bitcoin market then the answer is budmail biz or topics comi done think budmail biz ever took

from hoof hearted on february pmquote from kmf on february pmquote from hoof hearted on february pmquote from kmf on february pmalso ovdb didnt shut down before sr it shut down some time into s remember sr made a subforum for ovdb after it shut down the first drug forum i was ever on was called sandoz labs in before that there was the hive which i wasnt on but i believe it had a small private market associated with it but it is even further removed from the current markets of today than the classical forums were in that it was more informed than organized there was also the rcml research chemical mailing list that was before sand labs and i also was not on that i think sand labs was essentially the oldest forum that can be said as being part of the lineage leading up to ovdb it went more or lesssandoz labs the bible research chemicals net follow the white rabbit follow the green biker su pplier info the drugs tor first hidden service drug forum ever binary blue stars a figment of your imagination the looking glass ovdbthat was roughly the lineage my community followed from to whenever ovdb shut down im probably forgetting some of the forums and might have ordering slightly wrong quote also ovdb didnt shut down before sr it shut down some time into s remember sr made a subforum for ovdb after it shut down yes it seems as though youre correct my bad i cant remember the exact time frames but i do remember the ovdb sub forum on the sr forum ovdb must have closed down later than i recall it must have been very early on after sr was first launched i think it only operated for months it started around the same time as sr or maybe shortly before or after it i cant remember exactly which opened first they were both in development at the same time though but it shut down about half a year into sr since there was no reason to run it when sr was blowing up anyway in certain ovdb was in operation before sr first launched for how long im not sure but it was definitely up and running before sr first begun it must have been just before sr launched then because i remember reading ross talking about it on the bitcoin forum while ovdb was in the process of being set up in not too sure but it was operation prior to sr there were some great vendors on ovdb offering some amazingly cheap prices for top quality products . anyone remember dutch green club
